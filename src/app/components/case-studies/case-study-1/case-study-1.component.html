      <div class="prose max-w-none">
        <p class="text-gray-600 whitespace-pre-line">
          Jackfruit identified three broad categories of ECD providers:
        </p>

        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside ml-8">
          <li>
            Informal home-based daycares ("Mamapreneurs") – Operated by female
            entrepreneurs caring for children in their homes, these lacked the
            financial capacity to take on sustainable credit.
          </li>
          <li>
            ECD centers attached to primary schools – These benefited from
            stable revenue streams from older students and already qualified for
            Jackfruit loans.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stand-alone ECD centers – These faced financial sustainability
            issues, including:
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-8">
              <li>Low enrollment numbers affecting revenue.</li>
              <li>
                Irregular payment structures (daily/weekly/monthly instead of
                termly).
              </li>
              <li>
                Heavy reliance on cash payments, making financial tracking
                difficult.

          </li>
          <li>
            Experience & Longevity Consideration – Adjusting eligibility from a
            minimum of three years of operation to one year, balancing stability
            with early-stage financial needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enrollment-Based Eligibility – Reducing the minimum required student
            count from 100 to 50, making loans more accessible to smaller ECD
            centers.

            regulation, and social skills—essential for their overall cognitive
            and behavioral development.

          <li>
            Capacity Building for Educators – Teachers receive training in

            abilities.

          <li>
            Community Engagement & Parenting Support – Parents and caregivers
