      <div class="prose max-w-none">
        <p class="text-gray-600 whitespace-pre-line">
          Across Kenya, low-cost private schools face significant challenges in
          accessing financing to improve infrastructure, teaching quality, and
          overall learning outcomes. Many financial institutions perceive these
          schools as high-risk due to inconsistent cash flows and limited
          financial tracking, making it difficult for them to access capital for
          development. Without adequate investment, schools struggle to provide
          quality education, leading to poor student outcomes.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 whitespace-pre-line">
          Jackfruit has pioneered an innovative results-linked loan model, which
          ties financing to measurable improvements in school performance. This
          approach ensures that schools not only access affordable loans but
          also commit to improving education quality, teacher training, and
          student learning outcomes. In parallel, Jackfruit Foundation’s JF
          Upskill program provides essential capacity-building for teachers,
          equipping them with skills to enhance student achievement.

        Challenge: The Financing Gap in School Improvement
      </h2>
      <div class="prose max-w-none">
        <p class="text-gray-600 whitespace-pre-line">
          Many private schools in Kenya, particularly in low-income urban and
          rural areas, operate with minimal resources and lack access to
          traditional financing. The main challenges these schools face include:
        </p>

        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside ml-8">
          <li>
            Inadequate Infrastructure: Many schools need funding for classroom
            expansion, sanitation, and learning facilities but cannot secure
            affordable loans.
          </li>
          <li>
            Untrained Teachers: A significant number of teachers lack access to
            continuous professional development, impacting their ability to
            deliver quality instruction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Low Learning Outcomes: Without proper investment in learning
            materials and structured teacher training, students struggle with
            foundational literacy and numeracy.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="text-gray-600 whitespace-pre-line">
          To bridge this gap, Jackfruit Finance and Jackfruit Foundation
          introduced a financing solution that directly links loan conditions to
          improved learning outcomes, ensuring that education quality remains at
          the center of school investments.

        Intervention: Results-Linked Loans for School Development
      </h2>
      <div class="prose max-w-none">
        <p class="text-gray-600 whitespace-pre-line">
          Jackfruit Finance developed a data-driven, results-linked loan model,
          which offers financial support to schools that meet specific education
          improvement milestones. Key features of this approach include:
        </p>

        <ol class="list-disc list-inside ml-8">
          <li>
            Education-Based Loan Incentives: Schools that show measurable
            improvements in student performance, teacher training completion,
            and school management benefit from reduced interest rates over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data-Driven Credit Assessment: Instead of relying solely on
            financial metrics, Jackfruit Finance assesses schools based on
            enrollment stability, academic performance, and teacher training
            participation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Infrastructure and Learning Material Investments: Schools use the
            loans to upgrade classrooms, provide digital learning tools, and
            enhance school facilities, leading to better student engagement and
            retention.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="text-gray-600 whitespace-pre-line">
          This holistic approach ensures that financial support translates into
          real, measurable improvements in education outcomes rather than being
          used solely for operational expenses.

          <li>
            Teacher Training & Development: Over 70% of teachers in funded
            schools have completed JF Upskill training, leading to more
            effective lesson delivery and improved student comprehension.
          </li>
          <li>
            Higher Student Performance: Schools that accessed these loans saw a
            10-15% improvement in literacy and numeracy scores, as tracked
            through baseline and endline assessments.
          </li>

          <li>
            Increased Student Enrollment & Retention: Schools offering a better
            learning experience reported an average 20% increase in student
            enrollment, as parents recognized the value of quality education.
